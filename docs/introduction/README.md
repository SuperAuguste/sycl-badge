# Introduction

This is a small example that shows how to use the badge as an actual badge with a little game as a bonus.

## What's Inside

See `src/hello.zig` and tweak the the values to your liking.

## Running

## On the simulator

The simulator is ideal for fast iteration as it supports live reloading.

Run `zig build watch` and head to https://badgesim.microzig.tech/.

## On hardware

Once you're happy with what you've made, you'll need to flash it onto your badge!
